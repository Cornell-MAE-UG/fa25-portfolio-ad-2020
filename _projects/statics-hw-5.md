## Description
Problem Statement: Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground, and a linear actuator, design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. Assume all the support and actuator are rigid.
## Part 1. 
Initial problem solving work. I used a diagram of my mechanism (a lever and fulcrum), a chosen linear actuator from the catalog, and a moment balance to calculate the distance and weight my mechanism could lift.

## Part 2.
For the second part of the problem, the bar is now considered a non-rigid beam which bends due to the combined action of the weight and the actuator force. For my analysis, I considered only the forces transverse to the beam and

(i) found the maximum deflection in the beam

(ii) chose a mass-efficient beam design (cross section and material) such that its vertical deflection was below 2% of its length
